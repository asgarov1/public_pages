## 3. In-App Purchases

The App offers a monthly premium subscription. All purchases are processed exclusively by **Apple's App Store**. The developer does not receive, store, or have access to your payment information.

Apple's handling of purchase data is governed by [Apple's Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/).

---

## 4. Third-Party Services

The App does not integrate any third-party analytics, advertising, crash-reporting, or tracking SDKs. No data is shared with third parties.

---

## 5. Children's Privacy

The App does not knowingly collect any data from users of any age, including children under 13. Because no personal information is collected at all, the App is safe for all ages.

---

## 6. Data Security

Since all app data is stored locally on your device, it is protected by your device's built-in security (e.g., passcode, Face ID, or Touch ID). The developer has no access to your data and therefore cannot breach, misuse, or lose it.

---

## 7. Your Rights

Because the App does not collect any personal data, there is nothing for the developer to access, correct, or delete on your behalf. You can remove all app data at any time by deleting the App from your device.

---

## 8. Changes to This Policy

If this privacy policy changes, the updated version will be published with a new effective date. Continued use of the App after any changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
