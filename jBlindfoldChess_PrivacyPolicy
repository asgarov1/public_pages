# Privacy Policy for JBlindfoldChess

**Last updated: February 21, 2026**

## Overview

JBlindfoldChess is a blindfold chess training app that lets you play chess by speaking your moves aloud. This policy explains what data the app uses and how it is handled.

## Data We Collect

**We do not collect, store, or share any personal data.**

## Microphone and Speech Recognition

JBlindfoldChess uses your device's microphone and Apple's Speech Recognition framework solely to listen for spoken chess moves (e.g. "knight to f3").

- Audio is processed on-device and/or by Apple's Speech Recognition service.
- We do not record, store, or transmit your voice or audio to our own servers.
- Apple's handling of speech data is governed by [Apple's Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/privacy/).

You can revoke microphone and speech recognition permissions at any time in **Settings → JBlindfoldChess**.

## Chess API

To calculate computer moves, the app sends the current board position (in standard FEN notation) to [chess-api.com](https://chess-api.com). FEN strings contain only chess piece positions — no personal information of any kind.

## Third-Party Services

| Service | Purpose | Data sent |
|---|---|---|
| Apple Speech Recognition | Convert spoken moves to text | Audio (processed by Apple) |
| chess-api.com | Calculate computer moves | Chess board position (FEN) |

## Children's Privacy

JBlindfoldChess does not knowingly collect any information from anyone, including children under 13.

## Changes to This Policy

If this policy changes, the updated version will be posted at this URL with a new "Last updated" date.
